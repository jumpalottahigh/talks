```notes
- You might have heard people praising Netlify. Setting up CI deploys from a GitHub repo takes only a few seconds!

- Might have to scale quite a lot by the time you actually need to pay for anything

- Some benefits on top of traditional CDN - ability to build apps and has CI

- Builds and deploys when you push to your GitHub repo

- Free auto-renewing certificate with Let's Encrypt. Let's be honest, in 2019 https is a requirement and good for security, SEO and required for HTTP/2

- Buy or setup a custom domain in a few seconds

- On every PR submitted you get a preview build live at a URL without doing anything. So cool!

- Netlify Functions = AWS lambda without any setup

- Netlify Identity - a way to manage sign up, logins, gates content

- Add a `netlify` attribute to a form and get form data submissions right into Netlify

```

SCRIPT:
touch index.html
! tab expand, save
open .
open netlify, drag and drop the file
rename the subdomain for Glory

TALK:

Surely it takes quite some time to setup all those things, right? Wrong.

The dev experience is so nice, I'll deploy a site right now
