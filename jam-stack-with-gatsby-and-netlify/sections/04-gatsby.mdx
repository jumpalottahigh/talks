# Additionally

Show graphiql,
Images with initial low quality base64 inlined version, and blur up or traced svg effects on loading

# But also...

It's a perfect chance of trying out React and GraphQL.

Gatsby gives you <strong>tooling</strong> (Webpack, TODO:...)

### <strong>A hassle free way to try React and GraphQL</strong>

# Why Gatsby?

- Engineered for performance from the get-to
- TODO: put image of default starter lightouse score (and maybe a few other examples of real sites?)
- In legacy codebases we all know how hard it could be to work for performance - tech debt, a feature here, an improvement there

- Sample notes

# images

WebP:

- half the size
- with or without alpha channel
- supported by Chrome (which could be in many cases half your users or more; check your analytics)
- supported in Edge (since Oct 2018) and support continues as Edge changes engine to Chromium
- supported in Firefox

<img
  style={{ marginTop: 'var(--m-t-3)' }}
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/webp-support.png')}
  alt="WebP image format support across browsers"

# Why performance matters

- users are impatient
- KPIs - bounce rates, real disappointments, real money
- bandwidth is expensive
- the next 1 billion user on the internet

# Showcase of some of my projects

- solve practical problems - generate THOUSANDS OF images and make a super performant page in a few minutes and less than 50 lines of code. So powerful!: campaign-catalog
- generate hundreds of pages hassle free: baehrbg.com
- fpvtips

```notes
- gatsby can be very powerful - show example of a copy of the campaign catalog site to show how far you can get just with 10 lines of code. maybe with rendering sub pages for each of those sites too? 600+ pages real quick?
```
