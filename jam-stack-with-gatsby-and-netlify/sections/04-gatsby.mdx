```notes

- Many times introduced as "static site generator", but it goes well beyond that and is so much more.

- Gatsby is engineered for performance from the ground up. Starts off with a Lighthouse score of 100 across the board.

- Webpack, Babel, Prettier, ESLint, whatever you may be used to in a modern project

- GraphQL! Source plugins allow you to pull data from many CMS's and more. Contentful, Wordpress, Twitter, Shopify, Sanity, Stripe, IG, Trello,

- Drop in the generated files on any static file host

- PWA bootstrapper

- Awesome Dev Experience

- Many plugins and starters to get you going or to learn from

- The community is very passionate about the project and there are many contributors. It's easy to get started too.

```notes
- In fact, Gatsby is so performant,
- Someone might have even claimed that Gatsby would pull off Lighthouse score of 70+ running on a toaster at CDN edge
```

# But seriously, how fast is Gatsby?

```notes
- Plenty
- The default Gatsby starter comes with a score of 100 across the board in Lighthouse tests, so that should get you places

# #Perfmatters

- Your users and Your business
- Performance, Speed, User Satisfaction translate to Money
- SEO benefits as of July 2018
- Users are impatient
- Alternatively slow sites lead to increased bounce rates
- The next 1 billion users on the internet are coming
- Bandwidth is expensive

```notes
- Many reasons why to care for performance, but boils down to your users and your business

- Page speed is part of Google page ranking scores now

- Wouldn't it be nice to be faster than your competition?

- Future users might be coming from places with flaky connection and where bandwidth is expensive
```

    src={require('file-loader!../assets/webp-support.png')}
    alt="WebP image format support across browsers"
  />
  <h4>WebP image support</h4>
</div>

## How does Gatsby help?

- <span className="accent">gatsby-image</span> is a highly optimized lazy loading image component
- can serve WebP to browsers that support it
- WebP could be up to half the size
- with or without alpha channel

```notes
- Not gonna go super much in depth as to what all the things Gatsby does for you are, but

- Doing images right is important. Images are 50-70% of page size in many cases

- WebP has more and more support

- gatsby-image gives you all that
```

<img
  style={{ maxHeight: '7em' }}
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/graphql.svg')}
  alt="GraphQL"
/>

```notes
- A huge driving point to try Gatsby is if you want to try out React or GraphQL. Gatsby makes that very easy.

- If you are a React veteran you will feel right at home

- But even if you have never tried React, Gatsby is a great way to try it out.

```

---

# All of React

<img
  style={{ maxHeight: '9em' }}
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/react.svg')}
  alt="React"

```notes
- Because Gatsby just uses React under the hood, that means that you can use ANY react module from NPM in your projects. Pretty neat!
```

    alt="Gatsby architecture"
  />
</div>

```notes
- How does Gatsby function

- Architecture: fairly simple and many things are abstracted away from you and you do not need to understand them in detail

- Fetch data from various sources

- Process data and expose GraphQL schema for querying

- Build your app with React components

- Deploy to Netlify, AWS S3, GitHub Pages and more
```

---

# Before we dive deeper into the architecture...

```notes
... let's look at how we can start a Gatsby project.
```

---

# 3 easy ways to get started

```notes
3 ways of trying out Gatsby quickly:
```

---

### CLI

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-via-cli.png')}
  style={{ maxWidth: '80vw' }}
  alt="Gatsby via CLI"
/>

---

### CodeSandbox.io

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-via-codesandbox.png')}
  style={{ maxHeight: '95vh' }}
  alt="Gatsby via CodeSandbox"
/>

---

### Look for the green Netlify deploy button

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-via-button.png')}
  style={{ height: '200px' }}
  alt="Gatsby via deploy button"
/>

### Or pass a starter repository to Netlify via:

https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default

```notes

```

---

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/k3201jy9jo?fontsize=14"
  style={{
    width: '90vw',
    height: '90vh',
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: '4px',
    overflow: 'hidden'
  }}
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
/>

```notes
- For exmaple, here's how the default starter project looks like in CodeSandbox

- You could get quite far already from here:

  - work on project

  - create a GitHub repo from here

  - deploy
```

---

<div>
  <img
    src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-architecture-2.png')}
    style={{
      maxWidth: '75%',
      maxHeight: '52em',
      display: 'flex',
      margin: '0 auto'
    }}
    alt="Gatsby architecture focused on data sources"
  />
</div>

```notes
- Cool, so going back to our diagram here, let's now have a look at the different data sources that Gatsby can source
- so we can zoom in on and talk about data sources
```

---

<DataSources />

```notes
- Any data source; There's quite a few of them

- Build pages from Google sheets or Trello cards wut?

- Some worthy mentions that are less gimicky: popular headless CMSs like: Contentful, Sanity, GraphCMS and more...
```

---

# Let's try out <span className="accent">GraphQL</span>

```notes
- Gatsby sources all that data and exposes GraphQL types for you to query against
```

---

# Demo

```notes
TODO: come up with concrete examples to query; set them up in the codesandbox
```

---

export default Invert

<iframe
  src="https://k3201jy9jo.sse.codesandbox.io/___graphql"
  style={{
    width: '90vw',
    height: '90vh',
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: '4px',
    overflow: 'hidden'
  }}
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
/>

---

# Plugins

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-plugins-page.png')}
  style={{ maxWidth: '90vw', maxHeight: '95vh' }}
  alt="Gatsby plugins page"
/>

---

# Plugins

<ul>
  <li>Reusable common functionality</li>
  <li>Source plugins</li>
  <li>Transformer plugins</li>
  <li>Public vs Private</li>
</ul>

```notes
- ~ 700 plugins

- Chunks of reusable functionality, shared with the community.

- Things like Google Analytics, for example. No need to reinvent the wheel. Use the highly optimized and supported plugin.

- 2 special categories of plugins - Source and Transformer plugins

- Source that fetch data at build time

- Transformers that process data, for example a JSON file

- A thing to note about plugins is that you are not limited to only what's available out there. You can easily create your own custom private plugins specific to your project if you have a use case for that.
```

---

# Starters

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-starters-page.png')}
  style={{ maxWidth: '90vw', maxHeight: '95vh' }}
  alt="Gatsby starters page"
/>

```notes
- Finally if you really can't be bothered to setup something from scratch, there are plenty of pre-configured starters for particular use cases

- For example: by data provider, styling solution, SEO requirements and more.

- The one major downside is that once you setup a project using a starter you are on your own and don't get anymore updates

- The Gatsby team is working on this and THEMES are coming probably this year to allow for dependancy based starter usage
```

---

# Deploy

- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- Now.sh
- AWS S3

---

# Showcase

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-showcase-main.png')}
  style={{ maxWidth: '90vw', maxHeight: '95vh' }}

- If you are looking for inspiration

- Submit your own projects to the showcase if you like

Generate hundreds of pages from Contentful models

Hundreds of pages, prob almost a thousand, many images
```

# Demo

TODO: Build a site that generates 1000 pages and images in 3 minutes or less

```notes
- TODO: because the Gatsby showcase is built with "live" screenshots from sites, we can use the same plugin to build something of our own

- Maybe default starter + yaml into a demo of campaign catalog type of thing?
```

---

# TODO: If you want to learn more

- Docs
- Tutorial
- LevelUpTuts
- Learning from other starters or projects

```notes
- Follow tutorial, the docs are pretty solid
