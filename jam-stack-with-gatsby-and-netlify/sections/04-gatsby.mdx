```notes
- Gatsby is engineered for performance from the ground up. Starts off with a Lighthouse score of 100 across the board.

- Webpack, Babel, Prettier, ESLint, whatever you may be used to in a modern project

- GraphQL! Source plugins allow you to pull data from many CMS's and more. Contentful, Wordpress, Twitter, Shopify, Sanity, Stripe, IG, Trello,

- Drop in the generated files on any static file host

- PWA bootstrapper

- Awesome Dev Experience

- Many plugins and starters to get you going or to learn from

- The community is very passionate about the project and there are many contributors. It's easy to get started too.

  alt="Gatsby architecture"

```notes
- Architecture

- Fetch data from various sources

- Process data and expose GraphQL schema for querying

- Build your app with React components

- Deploy to Netlify, AWS S3, GitHub Pages and more
```

# Before we dive deeper into the architecture...

---

# Demo

```notes
SCRIPT:
npx gatsby new .
```

---

# Getting Started

<ul>
  <li>$ npx gatsby new my-site</li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/">CodeSandbox</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world">
      Click the Netlify deploy button
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

```notes
3 ways of trying out Gatsby quickly:

1 Click the deploy to netlify button - https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
2 CodeSandbox
3 npx - Bootstrap a new project using npx
```

# Data Sources

Any data source
Build pages from Google sheets or Trello cards wut?

---

# Build and tooling

- Webpack
- Babel
  All the good stuff

---

# Deploying

- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- Now.sh
- AWS S3

---

# Plugins

- Plugins break down, explaing types and roles

Chunks of reusable functionality, shared with the community.

```notes
Things like Google Analytics, for example. No need to reinvent the wheel. Use the highly optimized and supported plugin.
```

---

# Source plugins

You can use what's shared by the community
You can roll your own and keep it private if that's really needed

---

# Transformer plugins

---

# Starters and themes

- TODO: explain about starters
- TODO: mention about themes

---

# Showcase

---

# Let's dive a bit deeper

- React
- GraphQL
- graphiql
- data sources...

---

# Detail of how it works

- React, GraphQL
- Data
- Freedome
- bring the tools as you need them, don't get locked to stacks and technologies if you dont want to
- easily swap out a headless CMS for another one

Somone might have said could be ran on a toaster

```notes
- Hot takes: can get a score of 70+ on a toaster at CDN Edge
- if someone is looking for a side project :D
```

---

# Additionally

Show graphiql,
Images with initial low quality base64 inlined version, and blur up or traced svg effects on loading

---

# But also...

It's a perfect chance of trying out React and GraphQL.

Gatsby gives you <strong>tooling</strong> (Webpack, TODO:...)

### <strong>A hassle free way to try React and GraphQL</strong>

```notes
- Add webpack and what not images
```

# Why Gatsby?

Community!

Starters

# Why Gatsby?

- Engineered for performance from the get-to
- TODO: put image of default starter lightouse score (and maybe a few other examples of real sites?)
- In legacy codebases we all know how hard it could be to work for performance - tech debt, a feature here, an improvement there

```notes
- Sample notes
```

---

# images

WebP:

- half the size
- with or without alpha channel
- supported by Chrome (which could be in many cases half your users or more; check your analytics)
- supported in Edge (since Oct 2018) and support continues as Edge changes engine to Chromium
- supported in Firefox

<img
  style={{ marginTop: 'var(--m-t-3)' }}
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/webp-support.png')}
  alt="WebP image format support across browsers"
/>

---

# Why performance matters

- users are impatient
- KPIs - bounce rates, real disappointments, real money
- bandwidth is expensive
- the next 1 billion user on the internet

---

# Interactive demo

Some demo here

---

# What can you build with Gatsby?

- Landing pages
- Ecommerce
- PWAs

```notes
- notes here
```

---

# A few showcase slides with images

3rd party projects: Find some advanced examples out there. or some simple and slick ones. show SHOWCASE site

- elementsofai
- store.gatsbyjs.org

- TODO: add lighthouse images per each

---

# Showcase of some of my projects

- solve practical problems - generate THOUSANDS OF images and make a super performant page in a few minutes and less than 50 lines of code. So powerful!: campaign-catalog
- generate hundreds of pages hassle free: baehrbg.com
- fpvtips

```notes
- gatsby can be very powerful - show example of a copy of the campaign catalog site to show how far you can get just with 10 lines of code. maybe with rendering sub pages for each of those sites too? 600+ pages real quick?
```

---

# Learning resources

- Docs
- Tutorial
- LevelUpTuts
- Learning from other starters or projects

```notes
- Follow tutorial, the docs are pretty solid

- Look up things as you need them
```

---

# Contribute to Gatsby

- Easy to get started
- Get swag

```notes
- Speaking of which, if you are looking into contributing to open source, consider starting with Gatsby.

- People are very helpful! And you can even have a pair programming session with a member of the Ink team.
```
