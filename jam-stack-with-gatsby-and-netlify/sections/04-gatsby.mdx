```notes

- Many times introduced as "static site generator", but it goes well beyond that and is so much more.

- Gatsby is engineered for performance from the ground up. Starts off with a Lighthouse score of 100 across the board.

- Webpack, Babel, Prettier, ESLint, whatever you may be used to in a modern project

- GraphQL! Source plugins allow you to pull data from many CMS's and more. Contentful, Wordpress, Twitter, Shopify, Sanity, Stripe, IG, Trello,

- Drop in the generated files on any static file host

- PWA bootstrapper

- Awesome Dev Experience

- Many plugins and starters to get you going or to learn from

- The community is very passionate about the project and there are many contributors. It's easy to get started too.

```notes
- In fact, Gatsby is so performant,

- Someone might have even claimed that Gatsby would pull off Lighthouse score of 70+ running on a toaster at CDN edge
```

# But seriously, how fast is Gatsby?

<div>
  <img
    src={require('file-loader!../assets/lighthouse-gatsby-default.png')}
    style={{ width: '70%', margin: '0 auto', display: 'flex' }}
    alt="Gatsby default starter Lighthouse score"
  />
</div>

```notes
- Plenty

- The default Gatsby starter comes with a score of 100 across the board in Lighthouse tests, so that should get you places
```

# Performance matters!

- Your users and Your business
- Performance, Speed, User Satisfaction translate to Money
- SEO benefits as of July 2018
- Users are impatient
- Alternatively slow sites lead to increased bounce rates
- The next 1 billion users on the internet are coming
- Bandwidth is expensive

```notes
- Many reasons why to care for performance, but boils down to your users and your business

- Page speed is part of Google page ranking scores now

- Wouldn't it be nice to be faster than your competition?

- Future users might be coming from places with flaky connection and where bandwidth is expensive
```

<div>
  <img
    style={{ height: '18em' }}
    src={require('file-loader!../assets/webp-support.png')}
    alt="WebP image format support across browsers"
  />
  <h4>WebP image support</h4>
</div>

## How does Gatsby help?

- images could be up up to 70% of your site weight
- <span className="accent">gatsby-image</span> is a highly optimized lazy loading image component
- can serve WebP to browsers that support it
- WebP could be up to half the size

```notes
- Doing images right is important. Images are 50-70% of page size in many cases

- lazy loading of images in viewport, preload base64 small low quality image for blur up effect or traced svg effect

- WebP has more and more support
```

<img
  style={{ maxHeight: '6em' }}

### One of the easiest ways to <span className="accent">try out React and/or GraphQL</span> with no prior experience

<img
  style={{ maxHeight: '6em' }}
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/graphql.svg')}
  alt="GraphQL"
/>

```notes
- I think it's worth mentioning this, because many people come to Gatsby to try React or GraphQL

- And rightfully so, you don't need to know a lot of React or GraphQL to get started with Gatsby
```

---

# All of React

<img
  style={{ maxHeight: '9em' }}
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/react.svg')}
  alt="React"
/>

```notes
- Because Gatsby just uses React under the hood, that means that you can use ANY react module from NPM in your projects. Pretty neat!
```

<div>
  <img
    src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-architecture-1.png')}
    style={{
      maxWidth: '75%',
      maxHeight: '52em',
      display: 'flex',
      margin: '0 auto'
    }}
    alt="Gatsby architecture"
  />
</div>

```notes
- I find this diagram from gatsbyjs.org quite useful to help understand the basic idea

- Fetch data from various sources

- Process data and expose GraphQL types for querying in your app

- Build your app with React components

- Deploy to Netlify, AWS S3, GitHub Pages and more
```

# How to get started?

```notes
- Cool, so how do we get started with a Gatsby project?

- I'll show you 3 ways of trying out Gatsby quickly:
```

---

### CLI

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-via-cli.png')}
  style={{ maxWidth: '80vw' }}
  alt="Gatsby via CLI"
/>

---

### CodeSandbox.io

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-via-codesandbox.png')}
  style={{ maxHeight: '95vh' }}
  alt="Gatsby via CodeSandbox"
/>

---

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/k3201jy9jo?fontsize=14"
  style={{
    width: '90vw',
    height: '90vh',
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: '4px',
    overflow: 'hidden'
  }}
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
/>

```notes
- For exmaple, here's how the default starter project looks like in CodeSandbox

- You could get quite far already from here:

  - work on project

  - create a GitHub repo from here

  - deploy
```

---

### Look for the green Netlify deploy button

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-via-button.png')}
  style={{ height: '200px' }}
  alt="Gatsby via deploy button"
/>

### Or pass a starter repository to Netlify via:

https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default

```notes
- In particular if you are deploying to Netlify, just look for the deploy button on many gatsby starter repositories
```

---

<div>
  <img
    src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-architecture-2.png')}
    style={{
      maxWidth: '75%',
      maxHeight: '52em',
      display: 'flex',
      margin: '0 auto'
    }}
    alt="Gatsby architecture focused on data sources"
  />
</div>

```notes
- Cool, so now that we know how to get started, let's go back to this diagram and explore the data sources part
```

---

<DataSources />

```notes
- Plenty to choose from; Most popular headless CMSs

- Any data source; There's quite a few of them

- Build pages from Google sheets or Trello cards wut?

- Some worthy mentions that are less gimicky: popular headless CMSs like: Contentful, Sanity, GraphCMS and more...
```

---

# Let's try out <span className="accent">GraphQL</span>

```notes
- Gatsby sources all that data and exposes GraphQL types for you to query against
```

---

# Demo

---

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/codesandbox-json-example.jpg')}
  style={{ height: '55vh' }}
  alt="Example JSON files"
/>

```notes
- A couple of example JSON files in a codesandbox project
```

---

export default Invert

<iframe
  src="https://k3201jy9jo.sse.codesandbox.io/___graphql"
  style={{
    width: '90vw',
    height: '90vh',
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: '4px',
    overflow: 'hidden'
  }}
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
/>

```notes
- There is a convention to how type names get generated (all-, -Json)
```

---

# Plugins

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-plugins-page.png')}
  style={{ maxWidth: '90vw', maxHeight: '95vh' }}
  alt="Gatsby plugins page"
/>

---

# Plugins

<ul>
  <li>Reusable common functionality</li>
  <li>Source plugins</li>
  <li>Transformer plugins</li>
  <li>Public vs Private</li>
</ul>

```notes
- ~ 700 plugins

- Chunks of reusable functionality, shared with the community.

- Things like Google Analytics, for example. No need to reinvent the wheel. Use the highly optimized and supported plugin.

- Source that fetch data at build time

- Transformers that process data, for example a JSON file

- A thing to note about plugins is that you are not limited to only what's available out there. You can easily create your own custom private plugins specific to your project if you have a use case for that.
```

---

# Starters

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-starters-page.png')}
  style={{ maxWidth: '90vw', maxHeight: '95vh' }}
  alt="Gatsby starters page"
/>

```notes
- start from a configured project with plugins based on usecase

- blog, ecommerce, what have you

- or by data provider, styling solution, SEO requirements and more.

- The one major downside is that once you setup a project using a starter you are on your own and don't get anymore updates

- The Gatsby team is working on this and THEMES are coming probably this year to allow for dependancy based starter usage
```

---

# Showcase

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/gatsby-showcase-main.png')}
  style={{ maxWidth: '90vw', maxHeight: '95vh' }}
  alt="Gatsby showcase"
/>

```notes
- Browse for inspiration

- Submit your own projects to the showcase if you like
```

```notes
- TODO: Build a site that generates 1000 pages and images in 3 minutes or less

- TODO: because the Gatsby showcase is built with "live" screenshots from sites, we can use the same plugin to build something of our own

- Maybe default starter + yaml into a demo of campaign catalog type of thing?
```
