# Showcase of some of my projects

- solve practical problems - generate THOUSANDS OF images and make a super performant page in a few minutes and less than 50 lines of code. So powerful!: campaign-catalog
- generate hundreds of pages hassle free: baehrbg.com

```notes
- gatsby can be very powerful - show example of a copy of the campaign catalog site to show how far you can get just with 10 lines of code. maybe with rendering sub pages for each of those sites too? 600+ pages real quick?
```
