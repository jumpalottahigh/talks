# What is JAMstack?

```notes
Let's have a quick overview, but also let's not get lost in definitions
```

```notes
- The abbreviation stems from these terms
- Expand on each item
```

# const { J } = JAM

_"Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by **JavaScript, running entirely on the client**. This could be **any** frontend framework, library, or even vanilla JavaScript."_

- TODO: highlight the items in another color to be visible on projector

```notes
- This is where we will focus today
- The critical parts here being: RUNNING ON CLIENT and ANY
```

---

# const { A } = JAM

_"All server-side processes or database actions are **abstracted into reusable APIs**, accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services."_

```notes
- Nothing new, leverage the power of APIs
- Headless CMSs such as Contentful, realtime DB like Firebase, Google Maps API, you name it
```

---

# const { M } = JAM

_"Templated markup should be **prebuilt at deploy time**, usually using a **site generator** for content sites, or a **build tool** for web apps."_

```notes
- Also nothing too special, just prebuilt, usually generated markup
```

# Some examples

<img
  src={require('file-loader!../assets/jamstack-examples.png')}
  className="full-screen"
  alt="JAMstack examples"
/>

```notes
- Check the examples section at jamstack.org
- Any framework / library
- Headless CMS's and APIs
```

# Core ideas

- Better Performance
- Higher Security
- Cheaper, Easier Scaling
- Better Developer Experience

```notes
- This is the more interesting part.
- The ultimate goal of the approach.
- (BP) Prebuilt HTML from the CDN edge = fast!
- (HS) Less server side processes = less attack surface
- (CES) Scaling is easy and efficient for static files
- (BDE) Less things to maintain and faster time to deploy
```

---

# What JAMstack is NOT?

- Not a silver bullet
- Not about specific technologies (use your flavor)

```notes
- All of that being said, ...
- It's not the answer to all problems; Just a particular approach
- Ultimately engineering is all about making the right trade-offs based on your use case
```

# Trade-offs

- Engineering is all about making the right trade offs based on your requirements
- Choose the right approach for your project
