# What is JAMstack?

```notes
Let's have a quick overview, but also let's not get lost in definitions

Let's consider other terms, like AJAX for example. It is still somewhat used nowadays and we all know the meaning behind it, but not many of us really actually request any XML from a server

It's not about the term but what it stands for

I personally take the JAMstack in a similar way. Some strict definitions are not super important to me, the priciples behind it are.

```

```notes
- The abbreviation stems from these terms

- Expand on each item
```

# const { J } = JAM

_"Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by **<span className="accent">JavaScript, running entirely on the client</span>**. This could be **<span className="accent">any</span>** frontend framework, library, or even vanilla JavaScript."_

```notes
- This is where we will focus today

- The critical parts here being: RUNNING ON CLIENT and ANY
```

---

# const { A } = JAM

_"All server-side processes or database actions are **<span className="accent">abstracted into reusable APIs</span>**, accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services."_

```notes
- Nothing new, leverage the power of APIs

- Headless CMSs such as Contentful, realtime DB like Firebase, Google Maps API, you name it
```

---

# const { M } = JAM

_"Templated markup should be **<span className="accent">prebuilt at deploy time</span>**, usually using a **<span className="accent">site generator</span>** for content sites, or a **<span className="accent">build tool</span>** for web apps."_

```notes
- Also nothing too special, just prebuilt, usually generated markup

- So my goal is to highlight that there is nothing mystic about the JAMstack, chances are, we are doing most of that stuff already anyway

- Check the examples section at jamstack.org

- Any framework / library

- Headless CMS's and APIs

# Core ideas

- üìà Better Performance
- üîê Higher Security
- üíµ Cheaper, Easier Scaling
- üòç Better Developer Experience

```notes
- This is the more interesting part.

- The ultimate goal of the approach.

- (BP) Prebuilt HTML from the CDN edge = fast!

- (HS) Less server side processes = less attack surface

- (CES) Scaling is easy and efficient for static files

- (BDE) Less things to maintain and faster time to deploy

- Netlify's NPS is 96. This is bonkers and probably the reason devs fall in love with it
```

# What JAMstack is NOT?

- Not a silver bullet
- Not about specific framework or library (bring your own)

```notes
- A sort of disclaimer

- All of that being said, ...

- It's not the answer to all problems; Just a particular approach
```

# Consider the Trade-offs

- Engineering is all about making the right trade offs based on your requirements
- Choose the right approach for your project

```notes
- Lastly,

- Ultimately engineering is all about making the right trade-offs based on your use case

- If you'd like to learn more, there's this great article by Addy Osmani and Jason Miller from the Google Chrome team, that focuses on describing different rendering approaches.

- Article comparing SSR, CSR and hybrid approaches

```notes
- In particular this infographic where they compare some PROs and CONs of different rendering approaches is quite interesting.

- We don't have too much time to go too much in depth during this talk, but feel free to research the topic further if interested.
