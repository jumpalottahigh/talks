# Core ideas

- Better Performance
- Higher Security
- Cheaper, Easier Scaling
- Better Developer Experience

```notes
- (after all we are only serving static assets from a CDN edge)
- CDN done right plays a huge role in this (Cloud Front, Netlify)
```

---

# What JAMstack is NOT?

- Not a silver bullet
- Not about specific technologies (use your flavor)

```notes

- It's not the answer to all problems; Just a particular approach
- Ultimately engineering is all about making the right trade-offs based on your use case
```

# Trade-offs

- Engineering is all about making the right trade offs based on your requirements
- Choose the right approach for your project

# const { J } = JAM

### Client side JavaScript

- Many flavors - Vanilla, or your framework of choice
- This is where we will focus today

_"Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client. This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla JavaScript."_

---

# const { A } = JAM

## Reusable APIs

- Anything you need in your app - headless CMS, realtime DB, weather information, you name it...

_"All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services."_

---

# const { M } = JAM

## Prebuilt markup

- Your markup, usually generated by library / framework, can be vanilla

_"Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time, usually using a site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps."_

---

# const { Netlify } = JAMstack

---

# Netlify

- Dev Experience ðŸ’œ
- CDN
- SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt, auto renewing)
- CI with a GitHub repo
- Auto PR previews!
- Forms, Identity, A/B tests if you are into that sort of thing
- TODO: refine; add more

# 30 sec deploy demo

```notes

SCRIPT:
touch index.html
! tab expand, save
open .
open netlify, drag and drop the file
rename the subdomain for Glory

TALK:

Surely it takes quite some time to setup all those things, right? Wrong.

The dev experience is so nice, I'll deploy a site right now

# What is Gatsby?

<Appear>Static site generator that rehydrates into a React app</Appear>

And so much more...

---

# Detail of how it works

- React, GraphQL
- Data
- Freedome
- bring the tools as you need them, don't get locked to stacks and technologies if you dont want to
- easily swap out a headless CMS for another one

---

# What does Gatsby give you?

<Appear>- PWA</Appear>
<Appear>- Performance</Appear>
<Appear>- SEO</Appear>
<Appear>- Tooling</Appear>
<Appear>- Image processing</Appear>

```notes
- TODO: Make a very detailed slide or a few slides here; Images
```

---

# Additionally

Show graphiql,
Images with initial low quality base64 inlined version, and blur up or traced svg effects on loading

---

# But also...

It's a perfect chance of trying out React and GraphQL.

Gatsby gives you <strong>tooling</strong> (Webpack, TODO:...)

### <strong>A hassle free way to try React and GraphQL</strong>

```notes
- Add webpack and what not images
```
